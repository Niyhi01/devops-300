Completed all 7 redirection & text processing tasks:
1. History filtering to commands.log
2. /etc/passwd processing (awk, sort, uniq, count)
3. numbers.txt with sed (even → EVEN) and awk (odd lines)
4. system-resource.txt with date + tee
5. Failed login analysis from auth.log
6. error-watcher.sh (tail + grep + color + tee to log)
7. backup-summary.sh (success/fail detection + logging)

All scripts tested and working.
I completed Day 7. No excuses.
