3-Tier Network Design (Why we don't use flat networks)
- Access layer: Connects end devices (PCs, phones) – switches
- Distribution layer: Enforces rules (VLANs, security, routing) – routers/switches
- Core layer: Fast backbone between buildings/data centers – high-speed routers
- Benefit: Scales, secures, easier to troubleshoot
